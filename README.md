This is a chat application made with django. While the frontend is being made with react, the focus of this project is divided into two sections:
  
  - Working with the langchain library to process documents of the web into queryable context for the LLM to base its answer on.
  - Developing API endpoints so that the front-backend integration runs successfully.
